# Peggle (TBC - 2.4.3)

### [Downloads](https://github.com/Shanghi/PeggleTBC/releases)

***

## Purpose:
This is a port of the WotLK Peggle addon made by PopCapGames. All features should work, but the achievement easter egg will look ugly. The original WotLK version can be found [here](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13195-PeggleAdd-onforWoW.html).

Since it's a large addon, a load on-demand version was also made. When using that version, the main Peggle addon won't be loaded until you use the **`/peggle`** command. The downside is that you won't see things like duel requests or battles until you load it.

## Changes / Additions
* Many servers are strict about saying multiple messages at once, so now there's a "Maximum Chat Lines For /peggleloot" option.

* Normally you're limited to 5 active battle games, but now you can raise that limit in the options. More active battle games will mean there's more hidden addon messages to send in the background.

* Brag can now be used in any chat/channel except whisper, and can now be used more than once so that you can spam it in multiple places.
